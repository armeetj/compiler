# Grade (98/100)

- Correctness: 100%
- Quality: 90%

The complete passes, are pretty well-written with only some minor quality issues (manual folds,
reimplementing existing functions, etc.). Incorrect/icomplete passes are marked with an '*'.

## Remove Unused Blocks

The helper function `tm_of_l` is equivalent to `LabelMap.of_list`.

## Select Instructions

All the `cmp_op` cases in `proces_stmt` can be combined using `Types.cc_of_op` to convert from
`cmp_op` to `cc` (use the syntax `#cmp_op as op` mentioned in the write-up to ensure the argument to
`cc_op_op` is a `cmp_op`).

## Uncover Live*

`helper (List.rev instrs)` in `uncover_live_in_block` can be replaced with `List.fold_right process
instrs`
