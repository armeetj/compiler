# Grade (98/100)

- Correctness: 100%
- Quality: 90%

Overall, good job! Your code passes all tests and was easy to follow. In the
future, while not strictly necessary, try to make sure your code compiles
without warnings.

## Allocate Registers

Instead of writing out the callee-save registers in `get_used_callee`, use the
set `callee_save_regs` defined in `types.ml`.

## Prelude and Conclusion

`convert_instr` doesn't need to return a list since all branches of the match
return lists with exactly 1 element. Furthermore, this function could be
combined with `adjust_stack_access` to adjust `Deref` nodes as they are being
converted.
