# Grade (100/100)

- Correctness: 100%
- Quality: 100%

Overall, good job. I have a few small nitpicks, but there were no critical issues with your code. It was easy read and follow. Please make sure to add a `README.md` in each assignment folder detailing who wrote which pass and how many late days were used.

## Remove complex operands

OPTIONAL: Consider building the binding lists in a diffrent order so you don't have to reverse them before calling `construct`.

## Explicate control

OPTIONAL: `explicate_tail` shares a lot of code with `convert_atom` when it could simply call `convert_atom` instead.

## Prelude and conclusion

Some incorrect uses of `fix_label`. These have been marked out in the code.
