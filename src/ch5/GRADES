Good work. As a general note, the equivalence `(fun x -> f x) â‰¡ f` holds in
OCaml, so `f` is usually prefered over `fun x -> f x`. The same holds for
functions of multiple arguments as well i.e. prefer `g` to `(fun x y -> g x y)`.

## Remove Complex Operands

The helper function in the `Prim` cases can be replaced with a ~~right~~ left fold.
>> done
>> The `Prim` case in `rco_atom` still has an explicitly recursive helper function.
